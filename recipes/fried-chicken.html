        <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
        <p>Fried chicken, also known as Southern fried chicken, 
            is a dish consisting of chicken pieces that have been coated with seasoned 
            flour or batter and pan-fried, deep fried, pressure fried, or air fried.</p> 
            <p>The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior of the chicken 
            while retaining juices in the meat.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>     
        <ul>
            <li>1 chicken</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>2 cup flour</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 tsp pepper</li>
            <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>    
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, beat the eggs.</li>
            <li>In another bowl, combine the salt, pepper, garlic powder and paprika to make a seasoned salt.</li>
            <li>Add the flour to a third bowl.</li>
            <li>Prepare the chicken by first seasoning each piece of chicken to your taste with the seasoned salt.</li>
            <li>Then dip each piece in the egg and drag through flour until coated well.</li>
            <li>Fill a large pot or deep fryer half full with oil and heat to 350°F.</li>
            <li>Place the chicken parts in and fry until dark and crisp. The thighs and legs will take longer to cook – about 15 minutes – than the breast and wings, which will take about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat, let sit for 5 minutes to cool and enjoy!</li>
            <li>Serve.</li>

        </ol>
